# GANime
CGAN to generate anime-like faces. The training set used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset).
</br>
This is an example of a batch of 24 images generated by the convolutional network. Every image as a resolution of 64x64.

# Architecture
These are the arcitectures choosen for the generator and the discriminator:

# Strategies for a stable training
For a stable GAN training I followed some of the tips that can be foudn [here](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks).
These are the implemeented startegies:
* Input images are normalized between -1 and 1
* The last layer of the generator uses Tanh as activation function
* The loss function for the generator is $max \log D$
